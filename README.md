# React Unidirectional Data Lab

## Objectives

1. Coordinate components, actions, and stores to create a unidirectional data
   flow
2. Practice modularizing React applications

## Overview

As before, we're mostly giving students practice with the concepts that we've
been driving home. Students should by this point be pretty comfortable with
modular applications, and we're just about ready to introduce them to flux.
